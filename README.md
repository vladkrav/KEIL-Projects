# KEIL-Projects
Diferent projects that were done in a degree subject. 
These projects were designed for the Cortex - M3 microcontroller. 
This repository contain the following projects:
- P2_A4_vk: Calculate prime numbers in a certain interval in the shortest possible time, that is, optimize the code as much as possible.
- P3_A4_vk: Without ever storing the calculated numbers, the microcontroller will calculate and display the value of the prime numbers contained between an initial value and the value 65535.
- P4_A4_vk: Interrupts are added to the previous program, for different functionality to the application.
- P5_A4_vk: The RTX operating system is added. Synchronization mechanisms are used to solve the problem of concurrency between threads.
